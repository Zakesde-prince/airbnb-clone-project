# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. Users can create accounts, list properties, make reservations, and review stays. This project aims to strengthen full-stack development skills and provide a real-world understanding of how modern web applications are built.

### Project Goals
- Build a fully functional AirBnB-like web application.  
- Implement user authentication and authorization.  
- Enable property listing, booking, and review functionalities.  
- Practice backend and frontend integration.  
- Gain hands-on experience with databases, APIs, and deployment.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Django / Flask:** Python web framework for building APIs and managing server-side operations.

### Frontend
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Core technologies for building the user interface.
- **React (optional):** Used to create dynamic, reusable UI components.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite:** Stores data for users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.

### API
- **RESTful APIs / GraphQL (optional):** Enables communication between frontend and backend for data exchange.

### Version Control
- **Git & GitHub:** Used for collaboration, version tracking, and repository management.

### Deployment
- **Heroku / AWS (optional):** Used to host and deploy the live web application.

## Database Design

### 1. Users
**Fields:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `date_joined`  
Each user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

### 2. Properties
**Fields:** `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`  
Each property is owned by a user and can have many bookings and reviews.

### 3. Bookings
**Fields:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`  
Each booking links a user to a property for a defined period.

### 4. Reviews
**Fields:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
Each review is created by a user for a specific property.

### 5. Payments
**Fields:** `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_method`  
Each payment is associated with one booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Supports authentication and authorization features for role-based access.

### 2. Property Management
Enables property owners to list, update, and delete their properties. Each listing includes key details like price, description, and location.

### 3. Booking System
Allows users to search for available properties, make reservations, and track bookings through their account dashboard.

### 4. Reviews and Ratings
Enables guests to provide feedback and rate properties, enhancing transparency and user trust.

### 5. Payment Processing
Supports secure transactions between guests and hosts, ensuring accurate payment tracking for bookings.

## API Security

Security is a core priority to protect user information, financial data, and system integrity.

### 1. Authentication
Ensures that only verified users can access their accounts using secure credentials and token-based systems (e.g., JWT or OAuth).

### 2. Authorization
Restricts access to certain features based on user roles (e.g., admin, host, guest).

### 3. Data Encryption
Sensitive data (passwords, payments) is encrypted using HTTPS and secure hashing algorithms.

### 4. Rate Limiting
Prevents API abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given timeframe.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
Protects the system from SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks by validating and sanitizing all user inputs.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate the build, testing, and deployment processes to maintain consistent and reliable updates.

### Importance for the Project
- **Faster Feedback:** Quickly identifies and fixes bugs during development.  
- **Reliable Deployment:** Ensures tested code is deployed seamlessly.  
- **Consistency:** Maintains stable environments across development, staging, and production.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments through containerization.  
- **Heroku / AWS:** Used for automated and reliable application deployment.
